ZOOM MCP PROJECT - SIMPLE EXPLANATION
=====================================

WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
This project connects Zoom (video conferencing) with Claude (an AI assistant) so you can manage your Zoom meetings using natural language commands in Claude.

Instead of logging into Zoom and clicking around, you can just ask Claude things like:
- "Show me my upcoming Zoom meetings"
- "Create a Zoom meeting for tomorrow at 10am"
- "Delete that 2pm meeting"
- "Get the recording from yesterday's meeting"

HOW DOES IT WORK?
1. The project creates a bridge (called an MCP Server) between Claude and the Zoom API
2. When you run ./run.sh, it:
   - Automatically opens your Zoom meetings page in the browser
   - Manages your Zoom login credentials securely
   - Starts the connection between Claude and Zoom
   - Keeps your access fresh and valid

WHY IS THIS USEFUL?
- Save time: Manage meetings with simple text commands
- No browser switching: Stay in Claude while managing Zoom
- Automated tokens: Your login credentials are handled automatically
- Always fresh: The system refreshes your access tokens before they expire

WHAT CAN YOU DO?
✓ List all your upcoming, scheduled, or past meetings
✓ Create new Zoom meetings with details (time, duration, topic)
✓ Update existing meetings
✓ Delete meetings
✓ View meeting participants
✓ Get recording links
✓ Manage Zoom users in your account

QUICK START
1. Set up your Zoom API credentials (free from Zoom Marketplace)
2. Run: ./run.sh
3. Your Zoom meetings page opens automatically
4. Start chatting with Claude about your meetings!

TECHNICAL DETAILS (IF INTERESTED)
- Built with Node.js for the server
- Uses Zoom's official API
- Integrates with Claude Desktop app
- Uses Server-to-Server OAuth (more secure than user login)
- Automatically refreshes tokens so they never expire mid-use
- Cross-platform (works on Mac, Linux, Windows)

KEY BENEFIT
Instead of: Login → Click meetings → Manage → Copy info
You do: Talk to Claude about it → Done!

This is especially useful for people who:
- Use Claude for work every day
- Schedule/manage lots of Zoom meetings
- Want to save time on repetitive calendar tasks
- Prefer text-based interactions
